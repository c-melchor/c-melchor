### Hi there, I'm Christina 👋

I am a career changer, from fitness to ⭐ TECH ⭐. 
I loved working in the fitness industry, I worked a few customer facing roles and absolutely loved it. 
However, I found that the fitness industry was not challenging enough; so I dove into the world of development. 

Most recently, I have worked as a Software Engineer for a large Fortune 100 company, using Javascript, React, and Node daily.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have bungy jumped off the world's highest bungy bridge (S.Africa, 709 ft || 216 m)
